## Fuel Efficiency

Customers are very concscious with fuel efficiency, for various reasons:
- rising cost of fuel
- increasing concern for the environment

It's important to be able to predict the fuel efficiency of new cars during the
design stage. Many factors can effect the fuel efficiency, including:
- number of cylinders
- horsepower
- weight
- engine displacement
- rear axle ratio
- transmission type

## Using the mtcars dataset

The ```mtcars``` dataset can be used to build a model of the effects of car 
characteristics on fuel efficiency.  
An example of the data is below:
```{r, results="asis"}
data(mtcars); library(xtable)
print(xtable(mtcars[1:8,]), type = "html")
```

## prediction model

Using a linear model, I determined the effect of weight, number of 
cylinders, and horsepower on fuel efficiency (mpg), and used this model to create a
function to predict fuel efficiency based on these factors.
```{r}
fit <- lm(mpg ~ wt + cyl + hp, data=mtcars)
fit$coefficients

fitted_mpg <- function(wt, cyl, hp) {
  fit$coefficients[1] + fit$coefficients[2] * wt + 
    fit$coefficients[3] * cyl + fit$coefficients[4] * hp
}
```

## Comfortable App!!!

![MPG Prediction App](./assets/img/shinyapp.png)

The user inputs predictor values in the left sidebar, fuel effiency predictions
are output to the main panel, and plots below the prediction show how the mpg
compares with data from the mtcars dataset.
